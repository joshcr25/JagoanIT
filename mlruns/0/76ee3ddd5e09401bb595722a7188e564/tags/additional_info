{'summary': "This data was used by Hong and Young to illustrate the power of the optimal discriminant plane even in ill-posed settings. Applying the KNN method in the resulting plane gave 77% accuracy. However, these results are strongly biased (See Aeberhard's second ref. above, or email to stefan@coral.cs.jcu.edu.au).
